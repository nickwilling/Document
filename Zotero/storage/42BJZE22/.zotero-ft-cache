    Description
    Computerized and manual systems for modeling wildland fire behavior have long been available (Rothermel 1983, Andrews 1986). These systems focus on one-dimensional behaviors and assume the fire geometry is a spreading line-fire (in contrast with point or area-source fires). Models included in these systems were developed to calculate fire spread rate (Rothermel 1972, Albini 1976), fire shape (Anderson 1983, Alexander 1985), spot fire distance (Albini 1979, 1983) and crown fire spread rate (Van Wagner 1977, Rothermel 1991). The FlamMap program was developed for extending the utility of these models to a landscape-level where the necessary inputs have been mapped using geographic information systems (GIS). This paper documents the capabilities in FlamMap 3.0 and discusses some of the uses for such capabilities.
